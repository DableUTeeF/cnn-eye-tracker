# Dependencies  
All the required Python packages are listed in the top portion of the `utils.py` file. The image pre-precessing code also depends on an open-source software called OpenFace, which is available here: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/

# To Train Your Own Model  
## Obtain the Data from the WebGazer Project
https://webgazer.cs.brown.edu/data/
## Update Paths
Update the set of paths to your own as specified inside `utils.py`. 
## Run the Code in Order
Then, run the code starting from the `1-import` folder, then to the `2-build` folder, and finally to the `3-analysis` folder.
