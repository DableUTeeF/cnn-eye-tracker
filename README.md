# Dependencies  
All the Python package dependcies are listed in the `utils.py` file. The image pre-precessing code also depends on an open-source software called OpenFace, which is available here: https://cmusatyalab.github.io/openface/

# To Train Your Own Model  
Update your own paths as specified inside `utils.py`. Then, run the code starting from the `1-import` folder, then to the `2-build` folder, and finally to the `3-analysis` folder.
